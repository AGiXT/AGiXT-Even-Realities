Even AI Demo.

This demo is a reference demo based on the AI ​​question-and-answer function of Even App. It shows the process of developing an intelligent question-and-answer app by connecting to the dual Bluetooth of Even G1 glasses. 

Among them, the voice recognition part uses the Speech Recognizer that comes with the iPhone, and the AI ​​big model uses the Alibaba Cloud API (limited-time free token). You can freely replace other suitable voice recognition and AI big models. 

## Getting Started

Although this demo is developed using flutter, only the complete code of the iOS side has been completed. You can download and run it. The Android side is under development and adaptation, so stay tuned.

You can use visual studio or xcode to run the demo directly currently. It needs to be run on a real device.
